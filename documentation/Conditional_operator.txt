The bug https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/issues/1130
shows the problem with the conditional operator ?
indent_ternary_operator not aligning correctly.

The solution is to transform the simple call to a recursiv call.
The position of ? must be saved for each level and be used to
position the colon operator.
